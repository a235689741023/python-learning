Little Red Riding Hood
Once upon a time, there was a little girl. Her name was Little Red Riding Hood. One day, her grandma was ill. Little Red Riding Hood went to visit her. On the way, she met a wolf.
That's a good idea.
Little Red Riding Hood, the flowers are so beautiful. Why not pick some?
Help!
Help!
The wolf went to her grandma's house and swallowed her up whole.
What are you doing, dear grandma?
I'm just waiting to eat you, silly girl.
In grandma's house, Little Red Riding Hood found that grandma's ears, eyes and mouth were all very big.

The wolf jumped up and swallowed up Little Red Riding Hood. And then, he fell into a deep sleep.
Thank you, sir.
A hunter passed by. He killed the wolf and cut open its stomach. Little Red Riding Hood and her grandma were saved.
